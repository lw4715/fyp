New Developments In Network Forensics â€“ Tools and Techniques 

	So the purpose of intrusion analysis and collection of forensically sound network data is to seek answers to the following questions:
	a) Who generated the (incoming) intrusion or (outgoing) data
	transfer?
	b) What equipment/services were involved in gaining entry?
	c) From where did the intrusion come and what parts of the infrastructure were affected?
	d) Were they able to do this because of limitations and weaknesses of incoming/outgoing security mechanisms? 

	Live and Dead Forensic Analysis
	Dead, or after the event analysis, can also be referred to as reverse engineering. 
	increasing emphasis on performing analysis of live systems (live forensics) which refers to the examination of network traffic as it arrives and this has led to the term network forensics.
