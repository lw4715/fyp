Q Model:
	I: 		Concept
	II: 	Practice
	III:	Communication
	* 3 levels:
		1. Tactical/Technical: art (i.e. no fixed way) 
			Goal: how
		2. Operational: nuanced process 
			Goal: what (high-level architecture/attacker profile)
		3. Strategical: function of what is at stake politically 
			Goal: who/why
		(4. Communication)

General features of attribution:
	* too large and complex for single person
	* require division of labour
	* incremental procession

Current (limited) assumptions on attribution:
	* intractable due technical architecture and geography of Internet
		=> only a technical redesign of the Internet can fully fix the attribution problem
	* binary view, either solvable or un-solvable
	* attribution evidence is readily comprehensible

Attribution process:
1. Indicators of compromise (IOC) found
2. Technical questions raised
3. Facts gathered
4. More questions
	Note: Non-forensics sources of intelligence/geopolitical context/intuition can also start attribution process

Part I (Concept)
	Insights:
		* Aperture: scope of sources (high aperture more likely to solve)
			e.g. MOONLIGHT MAZE 
		* Individuals can be very significant
			e.g. CrowdStrike's Putter Panda
		* Perception (bias)
			e.g. Study of intelligence failures (1978)

Part II (Practice)
	1. Technical layer:
		- broad-based automated scanning/reports of aberrant computer behaviour
		- 3 types of IOCs: atomic, behavioual, computed
		- Entry via spear-phishing, USB
		
		* Targeting (what) 
			e.g. Epic Turla Operation
		* Targeting analysis (how) 
		* Infrastructure 
			e.g. US indictment of five PLA officers
		* Modularity (signature and hallmarks in malicious code)
			e.g. Operation Poisoned Hurricane, Stuxnet and Duqu
		* Pattern-of-life (schedules)
			e.g. US indictment of five PLA officers
		* Language indicators (var names, config settings)
			e.g. Careto malware
		* Mistakes (reveal name/file/IP/email)
			e.g. Silk Road operator username, Hector Xavier 'Sabu' Monsegur (Anonymous) IP
		* Stealth (anti-forensic activity e.g. data encryption, modify timestamp in log files)
		* Signs of lega restriction
			e.g. Stuxnet

	2. Operational layer:
		- Synthesize info from disparate sources (tech, non-tech, geopolitical)
		- develop hypotheses

		* Analysis of ability required by perpetuators 
		(target-specific info/ target reconnaissance/ payload testing capabilities)
			e.g. Stuxnet
		* Scope of offenses (Advanced Persistent Threats)
			e.g. APT1/Comment Crew, The Elderwood Project
		* Piecing together multiple stages
			e.g. RSA SecurID hack 2011, DigiNotar 'Comodohacker'
		* Evolution of intrusions
			e.g. Stuxnet
		* Geopolitical context
			e.g. DDoS attacks in Estonia 2007, Georgia War 2008, Gauss campaign 2012
		* Employees/contractors (insider)
			e.g. Verizon review 2013, Shamoon attack at Saudi Aramco, Maroochy Water Breach in Queensland 2000, pipline incident at Gazprom 2000

	3. Strategic layer:
		- Aggregating answers to operational questions to draw meaningful conclusions (adversary's motivation)

		* Form of damage revealing attacker's intent
			i.	direct and immediate	e.g. Shamoon attack on Saudi Aramco 2012
			ii. direct and delayed		e.g. Stuxnet
			iii.indirect and immediate	e.g. eBay breach
			iv.	indirect and delayed	e.g. demise of Nortel
			Note: Damange assessment to consider divergence between indended and actual damage
		* Analysing precedents 

Part III (Communication)
	Preparing and managing portion of attribution process visible to leadership, technical experts, public
	
	- Arguments for more openness/publicity:
		* bolster credibility
		* improve attribution 
		* improve collective defences
		* affect publicized (malicious) activity

Key limitations of attribution:
	* skill and capabilities
	* time
	* sophistication of adversary
