Transparent Rational Decisions by Argumentation
https://imperialcollegelondon.app.box.com/file/244863917931

transparency afforded by argumentation to support decision-making where standard decision theory

argumentation focuses on interactions where parties plead for and against some conclusion

An argumentation framework consists simply of a set of arguments and a binary relation representing the attacks between the arguments, and corresponds to a directed graph (args, attacks)

(IOW: arguments are the nodes and attacks are directed edges between arguments)

* Assumption-based argumentation: 
	- arg obtained recursively from given set of logical rules, supported by rules and assumptions
	- conflicts: contrary of assumptions
	- X attacks Y if X supports a claim conflicting with assumptions in Y

Argumentation frameworks are equipped with methods (typically referred to as ‘seman-tics’) for determining winning arguments

Advantages of argumentation:

	Argumentation provides a powerful mechanism for dealing with incomplete,  pos-sibly  inconsistent  information  and  for  the  resolution  of  conflicts  and  differences  ofopinion amongst different parties.

	it is useful for justifying outcomes.

	especially when decisions need to be transparently justified


Argumentation-based decision-making - qualitative decision theory [5]

Potential use cases:
	- decision-making under certainty(where the outcomes of decisions are known to the decision maker), e.g. in [12, 13]
	- strict uncertainty(where the outcomes of decisions are uncertain and no probabilistic information is available),e.g. in [1] and [9]
	- decision under risk (where some probabilistic information is known), e.g. in [15, 8].
	- collaborative decision-making(e.g. in [11])

Challenges:
	- lacks  means  of  formally  evaluating  decisions  as rational. 
	- when decision-making is collaborative amongst different parties and stakeholders, theinterplay between individually and socially rational decisions needs to be fully under-stood and strategic behaviour of individual parties towards individual good and awayfrom social good needs to be controlled.



Standard decision theory is well studied as a mechanism forrational choice, but haspaid little attention to the structure and content of reasons brought to bear to sup-port  or  argue  against  given  choices,  as  pointed  out,  for  example,  in  [4]

Transparent vs Rational Decisions
What do we need to do?
	- normative’ analysis of argumentation-based decision-making, in terms of ratio-nality criteria similar 
	- vastliterature in AI on formal theories of defeasible reasoning in the presence of variousforms  of  priorities  and  postulates  regulating  the  outcomes  of  this  form  of  reasoning(e.g. see [3, 10]
	-   Indeed, the support that argumentation gives to a decision is in gen-eral defeasible:  if a stronger, conflicting argument is present, then a weaker argumentmay be rejected.
