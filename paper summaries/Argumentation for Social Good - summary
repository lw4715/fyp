# Argumentation for Social Good

Proposal: use Argumentation reasoning to make decisions regarding:
* identify attacker (Attribution Problem)
* decide regulation rule while using data
* decide regulation rule while sharing data

Use cases:
* IOT
* eldercare
* AI in healthcare
* smart cars

Supporting evidence for argumenation reasoning for solving these types of problems:
* Rule prioritization in other security areas (Bandara et al. 2009)
* Prototype system for medical data access under EU (http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/projects/health-record/login_form.html)

** Abductive reasoning combined with argumentation are the core of the GorgiasB tool(Spanoudakis, Kakas, andMoraitis 2016)
*** Abductive reasoning: deals with incomplete info
*** Argumentation: conflicting info (modularity)

_________________________________________
preference-based argumentation framework

argumentation theory is a pair (\T, \P)
L←L1, . . . , Ln: (ground literals)
\T: arguments rule
\P: priority rules
L = rule1 > rule2 
_________________________________________


argument (T,P) supports conclusion L when it is derived from T (arguments rule) and supported by P (priority rules)

argumentation good for solving problems underpartial informationas only the arguments whose premisses are satisfied will play a role



// Attribution Problem
Main idea of Reasoner:
Model:
* reasoning rules: extracted during analysis of attribution forensics examples
* arguments: reasoning rules
* conflicting arguments: conflicting evidence (evidence deriving contrary conclusion)

1. build up and categorize evidence [social science technique, called the Q-Model (Rid and Buchanan 2015)]
	* different layers: Strategic, Operational, Tactical
2. construct arguments 
	* reasoning rules --- (construct) --> argument rules + priortiy rules
	* evidence used as premisses to support argument
	* conclusion: is this country responsible for attack
3. Attribution with the reasoning rules


EXAMPLES:
* Stuxnet (Symantec2011)
* APT1 (Mandiant 2013)

Extensions:
* automatic collection fo evidence
* represent quantitative strength of arguments
* extend rules by inferring used rules (consider symptoms of attacks)

// Data Sharing Problem
1. data sharing agreement (DSA) (Swarup, Seligman, and Rosenthal 2006) 

Policies: enforces when data is used, identifying if user/app is granted access and level of access

Main idea:
1. Given policies regulating use/sharing of data
	* policies: argument rules
	* conclusion of policy: conclusion of argument rule
2. find conflicts between arguments
	* conflict: 2 policies both permit and deny action for same/related preconditions
3. create hierarchical decision process model

Extensions:
* policies dealing with data integrity and availability
* make conflict resolution automatic (introduce general resolution rules)
* online learning
