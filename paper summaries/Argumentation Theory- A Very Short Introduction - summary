Argumentation Theory: A Very Short Introduction

Deductive logic could not help explain fallacies


Argumentation consists of four tasks: identification, analysis, evaluation and invention.

identification: identifying the premises and conclusion in text→(ϕ→ ϕ)→ ϕ
analysis: finding implicit premises and making them explicit (enthymeme arguments)
evaluation: decide if argument is strong or weak
invention: construct new arguments

Argumentation is a chain of arguments, where the conclusion of one infer-ence is a premise in the next one.

argument: set of statements
	i) conclusion
	ii) set of premises
	iii) inference

linked argument vs convergent argument
A linked argument is one where thepremises work together to support the conclusion, whereas in a convergent argumenteach premise represents a separate reason that supports the conclusion. 

linked argument: all premises are needed (AND)
convergent argument: any premises can indivudlaly lead to conclusion (OR)



Traditional vs Argumentation logic:

traditional: single inference, deciding whether given conclusion follows from given premise [monological]
argumentation: 2 sides of an argument [dialogical]
each  argument  is  subject  to  probing  critical  questioning  that  reveals  doubts about it. By this dialog process of pitting the one argument against the other, theweaknesses in each argument are revealed, and it is shown which of the two arguments is the stronger





3 Argument Attack and Refutation
i. ask an appropriate critical question that raises doubt about the acceptability of the argument.
{question the inference} When this happens, the argument temporarily defaults until the proponent can respond appropriately to the criticalquestion. 
ii. question one of the premises.
iii. put forward counter-argument that opposesthe original argument, meaning that the conclusion of the opposing argument is the opposite (negation) of the conclusion of the original argument. 

A refutation of an argument is an opposed argument that attacks the original argumentand defeats it.

This agreement is generally taken to mean that there are three kinds of arguments: deductive, inductive, and defeasible arguments of akind widely thought not to be inductive (Bayesian) in nature.

Defeaible arguments: with knowledge of new information, conclusion might not be true



4  Argumentation Schemes
Some of the most common schemes are: 
argument from witness testimony, 
argument from expert opinion, 
argument from popular opinion,
argument from example, 
argument from analogy, 
practical reasoning (from goal toaction), 
argument from verbal classification, 
argument from sign, 
argument from sunk costs, 
argument from appearance, 
argument from ignorance, 
argument from cause to effect, 
abductive reasoning, 
argument from consequences, 
argument from alternatives, 
argument from pity, 
argument from commitment,
ad hominem argument, 
argument from bias, 
slippery slope argument, 
argument from precedent.

CQ1:Expertise Question. How credible is E as an expert source?
CQ2:Field Question. Is E an expert in the field that A is in?
CQ3:Opinion Question. What did E assert that implies A?
CQ4:Trustworthiness Question. Is E personally reliable as a source?
CQ5:Consistency Question. Is A consistent with what other experts assert?
CQ6:Backup Evidence Question. Is E’s assertion based on evidence?


Implicit premises:
CK: common knowledge
COM: author's commitment
