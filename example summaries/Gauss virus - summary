The newest strain of the Flame super-virus identified by Kaspersky Lab, dubbed Gauss, may be targeting banks in Lebanon, stealing information needed by individuals interacting with their accounts.

Analysts believe the virus may be the work of the United States and/or Israel and be designed to attack assets held by Lebanese terror group Hezbollah.

one can deduce the identities of the trojan virus’s authors by examining its targets

Evidence:
1. 
(tech)
there were many similarities – in terms of how the Gauss trojan (which embeds itself on a system and activates itself in response to an internal or external prompt) was written and is deployed – to other recently discovered trojans, such as Flame and Duqu

(op)
Gauss comes from the same ‘factory’ or ‘factories.’”

2.
(tech)
level of sophistication in the Gauss payload

(op)
the new trojan and its “cousins” represent “the high end of nation-state sponsored cyber-espionage and cyberwar operations, pretty much defining the meaning of sophisticated malware.’”

3. 
(tech)
line of code which contains the word "white"

(op)
they believe is a reference to Lebanon.
Both words share the same root letters of LBN in Semitic lanuages

4. 
(geopolitical info) - Who
Flame, Duqu and the Stuxnet virus were all thought to have targeted Iran, specifically its nuclear program.

Hezbollah, which acts as an Iranian proxy on Israel’s northern border, would thus be a likely candidate to be targeted by whomever is behind the other viruses.

5.
(geopolitical info) - Why
“Naturally, intelligence about the movements of money in [Lebanon] might be useful information,”

“It might also be useful to drain certain accounts of funds as a way of slowing down operations.”
