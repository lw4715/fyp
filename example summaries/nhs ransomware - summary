1. similar incidents from Pyongyang
since 2013, hackers aligned to Pyongyang have been using malicious software to extort Bitcoin - the online currency demanded in last week's WannaCry cyberattack.

Lazarus has been blamed for a 2014 attack on Sony and the theft of $81m (Â£62m) from Bangladesh's central bank.
In those attacks, the group is believed to have worked on behalf of North Korea's government.

2. code similarity with previous attacks
"clear code connections" between Lazarus and WannaCry, adding that the evidence "strongly suggests that these hacking tools were written or modified by the same author".

Security experts said part of the WannaCry code was the same as that found in WHITEOUT, NESTEGG and MACKTRUCK malware which originated from North Korea.

3. level of sophistication of attack
the character of the attack suggested it had not been carried out on behalf of North Korea.
